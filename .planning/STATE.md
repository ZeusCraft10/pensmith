# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-06)

**Core value:** Every citation in every exported paper is real and supports the claim it's attached to — verified by re-fetching the live DOI/quote. The verifier blocks compile and export; no FABRICATED, MIS-CITED, or quote-NOT_FOUND ever escapes.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation NFRs (Phase 0 repo skeleton lands first; Foundation NFRs immediately after, in strict dependency order)

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 11 (Repo skeleton & plugin manifest) — next up
Plan: TBD (planning starts via `/gsd-plan-phase 0`)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-06 — Roadmap initialized from PRD.md + research synthesis

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Section-as-phase as load-bearing model — directory contract (`.paper/sections/<NN-slug>/`) enforces state isolation
- Two-tier source-of-truth — workflow bodies + templates shared between Tier 1 plugin and Tier 2 CLI
- `tier-contract.test.js` is a Phase 2 hard merge gate (not a wrap-up task)
- Verifier Pass 1 (DOI integrity + author/title fuzzy match) and Pass 3 (OA quote verification) are deterministic and blocking; Pass 2 + Pass 4 are LLM-judged and advisory
- Zero pensmith trace in exports — verified by zero-trace test in Phase 6
- OneDrive/iCloud/Dropbox/Google Drive detection ships in Phase 2 doctor (dev folder is in OneDrive)
- CSL via citeproc-js + bundled CSL files resolves PRD §17 citation-style open question

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Style-match (Phase 8) is novel-territory dual-use with no industry precedent; flagged for milestone-close review of guardrails before shipping.
- PRD §17 open questions (verifier prompt wording, section-dependency syntax, wave-scheduling algorithm, MCP SDK choice, PDF parsing library, style-match implementation, library index format, section renumbering policy) deferred to per-phase discuss-phase as planned.

## Deferred Items
